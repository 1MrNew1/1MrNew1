## Why normal people envy smart and smart envy God

### note all of this is just my opinion and is wont be written in depth yet
Earlier today i heard people who learn math quickly arent necessarily smarter than those who study slower i partially disagreed because when i studied physics 
it felt the ones who 'invented' the subject as they heard it were the smarter ones.
Our awful states of living have left many  uneducated or stranded, taking the spotlight from learning hard to invent to perform as a high functioning robot Yes we still need to be 'smart' but we learn solutions.

### Jessica's ass is so fine said Jimy while Mark starred at Her ass questioning Integrals
Stuying solutions without asking first is perhaps why most people find scientific subjects difficult or anything they haven't pondered about.
Jimy's Mind was intruded with  thoughts perhaps how cool he would look as her boyfriend or how successful he would be if she envied him while Mark was thinking calculus. However we cant blame Jimy because its in fashion to think such thoughts and only nerds or prodigies are to be good at math and else must be cool by occupying themselves with garbage. We need to fight the trend of study for money and embrace study for and to fillfull our curiosity, new ideas and theories will come at greater quantities if we do so.
